We used [MMDetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection) as toolbox for our network.
Please follow their [installation instructions](https://mmdetection.readthedocs.io/en/latest/get_started.html).
To manage our Python packages we used [(mini)conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).
Our environment YAML file to restore the package versions can be found in this repo.
Python version 3.8, PyTorch 1.11 for CUDA 11.3 and mmcv-full 1.5.3 was used for our setup.

We trained on 4 Nvidia Tesla V100-SMX2 32 GB GPUs, 6 cores of an Intel Xeon Gold 6248 CPU @ 2.50 GHz and 100 GB of RAM. With a batch size of four (one image per GPU) and two workers per GPU, training for 36 epochs took âˆ¼ 19 h.
